#### Parameters for strategies

##### Simple Copy strategy

The *simple-copy* strategy uses the mid-price (the middle price between the best ask and best bid of the orderbook) of a source orderbook and generate an orderbook using a predefined or custom pattern. The depth of the created orderbook is defined by the number of orders in each side with the *levels_count* parameter and the price difference between orders with the *levels_price_size* parameter.

Orders amount are set according to the source orders volume of the same price level.

| `levels`               | Levels pattern to use in case of `custom` shape. (ex: `[0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, 0.1]`) |

##### Copy strategy

The *copy* strategy uses a source exchange market to create an orderbook on a target market. The depth of the created orderbook is defined by the number of orders in each side with the *levels_count* parameter and the price difference between orders with the *price_size* parameter.

Orders amount are set according to the source orders volume of the same price level.

##### Orderback strategy

This strategy behaves like the *Copy* strategy and have the ability to order back the liquidity from the source exchange market.
An soon as an order is matched, the strategy creates an order on the source exchange with the matched amount and the same price without the spread. This way if the spread configured is higher than the exchanges fee the P&L will be positive.

##### Candle-Sampling strategy

This strategy copies trades from sources every *sampling_ratio* trade events.
It will trigger a market order with the same amount than the average trades amount being copied in the window.
The parameter *max_slippage* protect against price slippage, it will considere the target orderbook and reduce the amount of the order accordingly to avoid price slippage.
A random of 10% is applied on the *sampling_ratio* to make the strategy not deterministic.
The *period* parameter doesn't affect this strategy since it only reacts on sources trade events.

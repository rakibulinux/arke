#### Parameters for strategies

##### Copy strategy

The *Copy* strategy uses a source exchange market to create an orderbook on a target market. The depth of the created orderbook is defined by the number of orders in each side with the *levels_count* parameter and the price difference between orders with the *price_size* parameter.

Orders amount are set according to the source orders volume of the same price level.

| Field             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spread_bids`     | Spread for bids side (in percentage)                         |
| `spread_asks`     | Spread for asks side (in percentage)                         |
| `limit_asks_base` | Sum of amounts of orders of ask side                         |
| `limit_bids_base` | Sum of amounts of orders of bid side                         |
| `levels_size`     | Minimum price difference between orders                      |
| `levels_count`    | Number of orders for each side                               |
| `side`            | Side where orders will be created (valid: `asks`, `bids`, `both`) |



##### Orderback strategy

This strategy behaves like the *Copy* strategy and have the ability to order back the liquidity from the source exchange market.
An soon as an order is matched, the strategy creates an order on the source exchange with the matched amount and the same price without the spread. This way if the spread configured is higher than the exchanges fee the P&L will be positive.

| Field                   | Description                                                  |

| `enable_orderback`      | Flag for enabling orderback, could be: `true` or `false`     |
| `min_order_back_amount` | The amount of the trade must be higher than this value for the order back to be created, otherwise the trade will be ignored. |




##### Fixedprice strategy

This strategy creates an orderbook on a market without using any source market.
It creates an order arround the reference *price* with a random value *random_delta* added or substracted to this price.

| Field             | Description                                                  |

| `levels_count`    | Number of orders for each side                               |
| `side`            | Side where orders will be created (valid: `asks`, `bids`, `both`) |
| `price`           | Reference price for the strategy to create orderbook         |
| `random_delta`    | Random value for deviation of the reference price (maximum deviation = random_delta / 2) |



##### Microtrades strategy

This strategy creates random trades on a market with random amounts.
It is commonly used to create candles on a market with low activity.

| Field                | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `linked_strategy_id` | OPTIONAL. ID of strategy which will be referred (using for calculating price) |
| `price_difference`   | OPTIONAL. Change of calculated price (using if `linked_strategy_id` exist) |
| `min_amount`         | Minimum amount of order                                      |

| `min_price`          | OPTIONAL. Price for ask orders (using if `linked_strategy_id` doesn't exist) |
| `max_price`          | OPTIONAL. Price for bid orders (using if `linked_strategy_id` doesn't exist) |

##### Circuitbraker strategy

This strategy monitors orders on an account, compare prices with a source exchange and cancel those which are too far from current orderbook offers on the source.

It is a security in case the strategy which creates the market crash or have a defect.

| Field                | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spread_bids`        | Spread to apply on bids side (in percentage)                 |
| `spread_asks`        | Spread to apply on asks side (in percentage)                 |

The spread applied on circuitbraker strategy should be lower than the spead used by the strategy creating the orderbook.
